# SCAN-N-CROP

This project is a work in progress

## Current Goals
- Automate scanning in photos i.e. family photos
- Automate cropping the white space around the scanned in photos
- Allow scanning in multiple photos at the same time
- Possibly basic image corrections

## Current Dependancies
- `scikit-image` - for image manipulation
- `numpy` - dependancy for scikit-image
- `typer` - for cli app
- `rich` - for nicer cli interface
