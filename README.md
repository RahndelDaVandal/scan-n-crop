# scan-n-crop

### Goals:
- Automate scanning in photos i.e. family photos
- Automate cropping the white space around the scanned in photos
- Allow scanning in multiple photos at the same time
- Possibly basic image corrections

### Current Python Requirements
- scikit-image - for image manipulation
- numpy - dependancy for scikit-image
- typer - for cli app
- rich - for nicer cli interface
